1. Overview
-----------
This application was designed to aid the URLyBird customer service 
representatives (CSRs) with their job of booking hotel rooms for URLyBird 
customers. It allows the user to view available rooms, book rooms and provides 
the functionality to search for particular rooms based on hotel name and/or 
hotel location   

-----------------------------
2. How to run the application
-----------------------------
This application can be run in one of three modes and the steps for the 
different applications are almost identical. To run the jar, go to the 
directory the jar is located and run the following command on the command line:

	java -jar runme.jar <mode>
	
For the server application, <mode> is server. The command becomes:
	java -jar runme.jar server
	
For the networked client application, <mode> is blank. The command becomes:
	java -jar runme.jar
Note: If there is no server running, the client will fail to start properly.
	
For the standalone client application, <mode> is alone. The command becomes:
	java -jar runme.jar alone

------------------------------
3. Configuring the application
------------------------------
When the application starts, a dialog is displayed to the user asking for some 
running parameters. When the user enters valid values, these will be stored in 
a properties file (suncertify.properties) and will be the default values when 
the configuration dialog next pops up

---------------------------------
4. Running the server application
---------------------------------
To start the server, run the following command on the command line:
	java -jar runme.jar server

This will open up a configuration dialog where the user must enter a Database 
Location and a Port to run the server on. The user can enter a valid path to a 
database using the text field, or can use the file browser by clicking the 
"Browse ..." button. The user will also have to enter a valid port number.

Once the Database Location and Port number have been validated, the user will 
be presented with a window showing their selected values, a disabled button 
with the message "Server Running ..." and a clickable button with the message 
"Exit and Stop Server!". Clicking this button will stop the server and quit the
application.   

--------------------------------------------------
5. Running the client application (networked mode)
--------------------------------------------------
To start the client in networked mode, run the following command on the command
line:
	java -jar runme.jar
	
This will open up a configuration dialog where the user must enter a Host and a
Port to connect to a server on. The user will also have to enter a valid host 
address (either IP address or hostname) and a valid port number. Once the
values have been validated the client will attempt to connect to a server
running on that host:port combination.

If the client connects to a server, the URLyBird GUI will open.

If the client fails to connect to a server, a dialog will be displayed and the 
application will exit when the dialog is closed.

---------------------------------------------------
6. Running the client application (standalone mode)
---------------------------------------------------
To start the client in standalone mode, run the following command on the
command line:
	java -jar runme.jar alone

This will open up a configuration dialog where the user must enter a Database 
Location. The user can enter a valid path to a database using the text field, 
or can use the file browser by clicking the "Browse ..." button.

If the database is valid, the URLyBird GUI will open.

-------------------------
7. Using the URLyBird GUI
-------------------------
The URLyBird GUI is made up of three main components.

Table:
	There is a table of records displaying the available rooms to the user.
	
	The width of these columns can be modified by dragging a column edge to 
	make the column bigger or smaller.

Search:
	The upper right corner of the application houses a text field and a search 
	button.
	
	When the search button is pressed, any records that contain the	contents of
	the search field in either the "Name" or "Location" columns will be 
	returned. 
	
	An empty search will return all records again.
	
	Note: This search is case sensitive

Booking:
	At the bottom of the application is a "Book" button. If you are selecting a
	record and you click book, you will be prompted to enter an 8 digit
	customer ID.
	
	Upon entering a valid customer ID, the application will confirm the room
	has not been booked or deleted and will book the room by entering the
	customer ID in the "Owner" column.
	
	Note: Once a room has been booked, it cannot be cancelled or booked again.
	
	Note: If the application has been idle, it is likely the records shown may 
	be out of date. In order to refresh the table, perform a search.
