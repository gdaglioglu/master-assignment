======= 1. Overview =======

This application is designed to aid the URLyBird customer service representative
(CSR) in booking hotel rooms for their customer.
It allows the CSR to view available rooms and offers the functionality to search 
by hotel name and/or location in addition to room booking.
The list of rooms are retrieved from a database file.



======= 2. How to run the application =======

The steps for running the application in all 3 modes are almost identical. To
run the jar navigate to the directory that the jar is placed in and in command line run the command:

    java -jar runme.jar <mode>

In client mode the <mode> can be omitted like so: java -jar runme.jar    
    Client mode must be run in combination with a running server, 
    if there is no server the application will display an error and shut down.

In server mode the <mode> is given as: java -jar runme.jar server
    This starts the server application.

In standalone client mode the mode is given as: java -jar runme.jar alone
    This starts the client in local mode.



======= 3. Configuring the application =======

When the application starts up in any mode a configuration window is displayed to
the user. When the user enters valid parameters they will be saved in a properties file
called suncertify.properties. 
If the application starts up and detects an existing properties file it will 
load the values from the file to save the user re-typing them. the properties file 
will then be overwritten with the values from the new start up.



======= 4. Running the server application =======

To start the server application the user must run the following command from the command line:

    java -jar runme.jar server

This will open up the configuration dialog for the server. The user must enter a
valid path to the database file through the text field or the file chooser window,
the port they wish to start the server on and confirm the options.

The option to enter a host name is disabled as the server will always run on the 
local host of the machine running the application

If the options are valid the server window will open and display the options that it will attempt
to start the server on. The user can then press the "Start Server" button to start the server.

To stop the server the user can press the "Exit" button, or go File -> Quit in the menu bar or close the window.

N.B The server must be running for the network client to connect to.



======= 5. Running the client application =======

To start the client application the user must run the following command from the command line with no parameters:

    java -jar runme.jar

This will open up the configuration dialog for the client. The user must enter a
valid host name that corresponds to the address that the server is running on,
the port they wish to start the server on and confirm the options.

The default values are Host name: localhost, Port: 1099.

If a viable connection is established a the client window will open and display a list of rooms.

If no viable connection can be established the application will display an error 
and will inform the user that the application is shutting down, then exit.

For information on using the client check Section 7. Using the URLyBird GUI.



======= 6. Running the standalone application (non-network/local mode) =======

To start the client application the user must run the following command from the command line with no parameters:

    java -jar runme.jar alone

This will open up the configuration dialog for the client. The user must enter a
valid path to the database file through the text field or the file chooser window
and confirm the option.

If the database path is valid the client window will open and display a list of rooms.

For information on using the client check Section 7. Using the URLyBird GUI.



======= 7. Using the URLyBird GUI =======

The URLyBird GUI is made up of multiple components.

There is a menu bar giving the user the option to quit, File -> Quit.

Records: 
    There is a table of records displaying the rooms in the database to the user.
    This table is populated by default when the window opens with all the records in the database.

    Pressing the "Search" button when no search criteria have been entered or
    pressing the "Load Table" button will also load all the records in the database.

Search:

    The client offers the functionality to search all records in the database
    matching the criteria "Hotel name", "Location" or both.

    The criteria must be entered in their respective search fields 
    and the "Search" button must be pressed to display the results of the search.
    The results of the search are displayed in the records table

    If no criteria are provided all records are displayed in the records table.

    N.B The search is case sensitive and must match the data in the record.
    e.g. if record is location is "Smallville" then entering "smallville" will not retrieve the record.

Reserve:

    The client offers the functionality to reserve a room in the records table. This updates the record in the database.
    
    The user must select a record from the records table and press the "Reserve Room" button.
    This will display a dialog where the user can enter their CSR number. 
    Entering the CSR number and confirming will update the record as reserved.

    N.B The CSR number must be numeric and must be 8 digits long.

    If a record is already reserved the CSR number will appear in the records table.
    The user cannot reserve/re-reserve a record that is already reserved.
