1. Overview
-----------

The URLyBird application allows users to search for hotels rooms and to book selected rooms on behalf of clients.
The user can search for hotel rooms by name and / or location.  Data is persisted to a database file.  The application
may be run locally or as a distributed system.

2. Requirements
---------------

URLyBird requires a minimum of Java version 1.7 to run.  If running the application in standalone mode or server mode,
the database file must be located on the same machine that the application is running on.  If the application is to be
run in network client mode, there must already be a server running to accept client requests.

3. Starting the application
---------------------------

URLyBird comes packaged as an executable jar file.  The archive file "runme.jar" is this executable.  The commands to
start the application all have similar form, with just mode "flags" differentiating them.  They take the form:

    java -jar <path_to_runme.jar> [<mode>]

The mode flag must be either "server", indicating the server program must run, "alone", indicating standalone mode,
or left out entirely, in which case the network client and gui must run.

Application configuration data is persisted between runs to a file called "suncertify.properties".  When the application
is run for the first time, this file will not exist.  It will however be created in the current working directory
and the configuration data entered by the user will be saved to the file.  Whenever configuration data is inaccessible
for whatever reason (suncertify.properties isn't locatable or doesn't contain the correct data), the user will be
informed of this and prompted to input the data manually.

3.1 Running the application in standalone mode
----------------------------------------------

Assuming that the current working directory contains runme.jar, the application may be started in standalone mode with
the following command:

    java -jar runme.jar alone

A dialog should now appear on the screen.  Click the "Browse" button to open a file chooser and select the database
file.  Once a database file with file extension '.db' has been selected the "Connect" button is enabled.  To display the
main GUI, click the "Connect" button.  The application will now read the data from the selected file and display all
available rooms in the client GUI.

3.2 Running the application in server mode
------------------------------------------

Assuming once again that the current working directory contains runme.jar, start the application in server mode with
the following command:

    java -jar runme.jar server

The server GUI will now be displayed.  To select a database file, click the "Browse" button and navigate to the desired
file using the file chooser.  To set the port that the server should listen for requests on, enter a port number in the
"Port Number" text field.  Valid port numbers are in the range 1025 - 65535 inclusive.  Note that the selected port
must not be in use by another application or URLyBird will not start.  Once a database file is selected and a valid port
number entered the "Start" button becomes enabled.  Click the "Start" button to run the server.  The server will now
listen for requests from remote clients.

3.3 Running the application in network client mode
