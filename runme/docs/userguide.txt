1 Running the URLyBird Application
The URLyBird application can be run in three possible modes;
 * Networked Client,
 * Server,
 * and, Standalone Client.

1.1. Networked Client
  This application mode opens a Client GUI instance. The Client connects to a
running RMI Server Instance. The Client GUI interacts with the Database via the
network. To start the URLyBird application in networked client mode, pass the
following Command Line Arguments.
    java -jar URLyBird.jar

1.2. Server
  This application mode opens a Server GUI instance. When in this mode, the
URLyBird Application starts the RMI connections. This accepts incoming network
requests from the URLyBird Client instances. To start the URLyBird Application
in server mode, pass the following Command Line Arguments.
    java -jar URLyBird.jar server

1.3. Standalone Client
  This application mode opens a Client GUI instance. The Client connects
directly to the database. There are no RMI network requests sent. To start the
URLyBird application in standalone client mode, pass the following Command Line
Arguments.
    java -jar URLyBird.jar alone


2. Using the Client GUI
2.1. Search Function
To search for a room, enter its Hotel name and/or its location in the text boxes
marked "Name" and "Location". If one or more of the text boxes are left blank,
they will be taken as wildcards and match all values.

Consider the following cases;
 * If the "Name" text box is left blank and the "Location" text box has the
   value "Whoville", all the hotels in Whoville will be returned, should they
   exist.
 * If the "Name" text box has the value "Palace" and the "Location" text box is
   left blank, all the locations where the Palace hotels are will be returned,
   should they exist.
 * If the "Name" text box has the value "Palace" and the "Location" text box has
   the value "Whoville", the Palace hotel in Whoville will be returned, should
   it exist.

To reset the search filter, and display all the records again, remove any text
from the "Name" and "Location" text boxes and click the "Search" button.
